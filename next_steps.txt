# COVID-19 & Election Data Dashboard Project Summary

## Project Overview
Interactive web dashboard analyzing COVID-19 pandemic data alongside 2020 Presidential Election results to explore correlations between public health outcomes and political geography.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), no frameworks
- **Visualization**: Chart.js v3.9.1 for interactive charts
- **Data Processing**: Papa Parse v5.4.1 for CSV handling
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, no server dependencies
- **Hosting**: Static files served from web server

## Data Sources
- **COVID Data**: NY Times COVID-19 repository (states, counties, colleges, prisons, etc.)
- **Election Data**: MIT Election Lab 2020 Presidential results by county
- **File Format**: CSV files loaded dynamically via fetch()

## Current Critical Issue: Dynamic Selectors Not Appearing

### Problem Description
The dashboard has a dynamic selector system that should show dropdowns based on selected data type:
- Select "US States" → Should show State dropdown
- Select "US Counties" → Should show County + State dropdowns  
- Select other data types → Should show relevant field dropdowns

**Current Status**: No dynamic selectors appear when data types are selected. The `selectorsRow` div remains hidden.

### Symptoms
1. Data loads successfully (confirmed via console logs)
2. `createDynamicSelectors()` and `populateDynamicSelectors()` functions exist
3. `selectorConfigs` object is properly defined
4. `selectorsRow` div exists in HTML
5. All verification checks pass, but selectors still don't appear
6. No JavaScript errors in browser console
7. "Add Region" button remains disabled

```

### Key Code Components

#### Selector Configuration
```javascript
const selectorConfigs = {
    'us-states': [
        { key: 'date', label: 'Date', type: 'select' },
        { key: 'state', label: 'State', type: 'select' }
    ],
    'us-counties': [
        { key: 'date', label: 'Date', type: 'select' },
        { key: 'county', label: 'County', type: 'select' },
        { key: 'state', label: 'State', type: 'select' }
    ],
    // ... other data types
};
```

#### Critical Functions
1. `loadData()` - Fetches CSV, calls selector creation functions
2. `createDynamicSelectors(dataType)` - Creates DOM elements for selectors
3. `populateDynamicSelectors(dataType)` - Populates dropdowns with data
4. `updateDependentSelectors(dataType)` - Handles cascading selections

#### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="controls-row" id="selectorsRow" style="display: none;">
    <!-- Dynamic selectors should be added here -->
</div>
```

### Fixes Attempted
1. **Syntax Errors**: Fixed escaped quote issues in JavaScript
2. **Function Calls**: Ensured `loadData()` calls selector functions immediately
3. **Function Existence**: Verified all selector functions are present
4. **Data Format**: Fixed region label formatting (`'County, State'` vs `'County - State'`)
5. **Political Analysis**: Moved from checkbox to button toggle (working)
6. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive console logging
7. **CSS Styling**: Added proper button styling

### Debug Information
- All verification checks pass ✅
- Functions exist and are called ✅  
- Data loads successfully ✅
- No JavaScript console errors ✅
- **But selectors still don't appear** ❌

### Suspected Issues
1. **Timing Problem**: Selectors created before DOM ready?
2. **CSS Display Issue**: Elements created but not visible?
3. **Event Handler Problem**: `onchange` for data type selector not firing?
4. **Scope Issue**: Functions called but in wrong context?
5. **Race Condition**: Multiple rapid calls causing conflicts?

### Working Reference
The `election_dashboard.html` has a simpler but working selector system:
- Static State/County dropdowns
- Manual population via `loadCountiesForState()`
- No dynamic creation, just show/hide and populate

### Next Steps Needed
1. **Deep Debug**: Add step-by-step logging to trace execution flow
2. **DOM Inspection**: Verify if elements are created but hidden
3. **Event Debugging**: Confirm `loadData()` is actually called on dropdown change
4. **Simplification**: Consider reverting to static selectors like election dashboard
5. **Browser Testing**: Test in different browsers for compatibility issues

### Development Environment
- Local development with Python HTTP server
- Production deployment via SSH to `bataleon` server
- Files synced with `sync_simple.sh` script
- Multiple backups created during debugging process

### Success Criteria
When working correctly:
1. Select "US States" → State dropdown appears immediately
2. Select "US Counties" → County and State dropdowns appear
3. Selecting values enables "Add Region" button
4. Selected regions can be added for analysis and visualization

**The core mystery**: All code verification passes, but the visual selectors never appear in the browser.
