# üöÄ COVID-19 + Election Data Integration - Final Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Based on your test results, you have:
- ‚úÖ Integrated COVID dashboard with political features
- ‚úÖ Election data file (`countypres_2020.csv`) 
- ‚úÖ COVID data directory (`nytimes_covid-19-data/`)
- ‚úÖ Updated sync script with integration support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Political data integration needs verification

## üîß Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Replace Test Script (Optional)
```bash
# Replace the test script with the fixed version
cp test_integration.sh test_integration.sh.backup
# Then copy the fixed version from the artifacts above
```

### 2. Replace Sync Script
```bash
# Backup current sync script
cp sync.sh sync.sh.backup

# Replace with updated sync script (copy from artifacts above)
# The new sync script includes:
# - Integration mode (-i flag)
# - Election data deployment
# - Integration verification
```

### 3. Test Integration (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the fixed test script
./test_integration.sh
```

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Integration Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy COVID dashboard + election data + core files
./sync.sh -i

# This deploys:
# - covid_dashboard.html (with political integration)
# - countypres_2020.csv (election data)
# - election_dashboard.html (standalone election dashboard)
# - index.html, README_WEB.md
# - nytimes_covid-19-data/ (COVID data directory)
```

### Option 2: Quick Dashboard Update
```bash
# If you just updated the dashboard
./sync.sh -d
```

### Option 3: Full Project Sync
```bash
# Deploy everything
./sync.sh
```

### Option 4: Force Deployment (No Prompts)
```bash
# For automated deployment
./sync.sh -i -f
```

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### 1. Basic Access Test
```bash
curl -I http://bataleon/covid_elections/
# Should return HTTP 200

curl -I http://bataleon/covid_elections/countypres_2020.csv
# Should return HTTP 200 (election data accessible)
```

### 2. Manual Browser Testing

**Open:** `http://bataleon/covid_elections/`

**Test Sequence:**
1. Select "US States" data type
2. Add "Florida" 
3. ‚úÖ Check "Show Political Analysis"
4. **Expected:** Region tag shows `Florida [us-states] D:47% R:51%` (approximate)

**Test Counties:**
1. Select "US Counties (Recent)" data type  
2. Add "Orange, Florida"
3. Enable political analysis
4. **Expected:** Political data integration works

### 3. Verify Integration Features

Look for these elements in the dashboard:
- [ ] Political analysis checkbox in controls
- [ ] Enhanced region tags with vote percentages
- [ ] Political summary section (when analysis enabled)
- [ ] Additional political charts
- [ ] Enhanced comparison table with political columns

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Political Data Found
**Symptoms:** Region tags don't show vote percentages

**Fix:** Check election data format
```bash
# Verify election data structure
head -5 countypres_2020.csv

# Should show:
# year,state,state_po,county_name,county_fips,office,candidate,party,candidatevotes,totalvotes,version,mode
# 2020,ALABAMA,AL,Autauga,01001,US PRESIDENT,DONALD J TRUMP,REPUBLICAN,18568,24973,20220315,TOTAL
```

### Issue: Chart.js or Papa Parse Errors
**Symptoms:** JavaScript console errors

**Fix:** Check CDN references in dashboard:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.9.1/dist/chart.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/PapaParse/5.4.1/papaparse.min.js"></script>
```

### Issue: Permission Errors
**Symptoms:** 403 Forbidden errors

**Fix:** Check file permissions on server:
```bash
ssh raymond@bataleon
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/covid_elections/
sudo find /var/www/html/covid_elections/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/html/covid_elections/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Working Integration Should Show:

1. **Region Tags with Political Data:**
   ```
   Orange, Florida [us-counties] D:47% R:51% [√ó]
   Los Angeles, California [us-counties] D:71% R:27% [√ó]
   ```

2. **Political Summary Section:**
   ```
   Political Makeup Summary (2020 Election):
   [47.2%] [51.8%] [1.0%] [1/1] [1,234,567] [2/2]
   Democrat Republican Other Dem/Rep Total Regions
   Vote Share Vote Share      Wins   Votes w/ Data
   ```

3. **Additional Charts:**
   - Political Breakdown Chart (bar chart with D vs R percentages)
   - Enhanced comparison table with political columns

### Test Cases to Try:

**Swing States:**
- Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia
- Should show competitive percentages

**Solid Blue/Red:**
- California (blue), Alabama (red)
- Should show clear partisan lean

**Urban vs Rural Counties:**
- Los Angeles, CA (blue) vs rural Texas counties (red)

## üéØ Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Deployment Successful If:**
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Political analysis checkbox appears
- Selecting US regions + enabling analysis shows vote percentages
- Charts render with political data
- No JavaScript console errors

‚úÖ **Integration Working If:**
- Region tags show `D:XX% R:XX%` format
- Political summary section appears with statistics
- Additional political charts render
- Comparison table includes political columns

## üö® Rollback Plan

If integration causes issues:

```bash
# Restore previous dashboard
cp covid_dashboard.html.nav-backup-20250625-170017 covid_dashboard.html

# Deploy clean version
./sync.sh -d

# Or restore from server backup
ssh raymond@bataleon
sudo cp /tmp/covid_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/covid_dashboard.html /var/www/html/covid_elections/
```

## üìà Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Document Findings:** Start analyzing COVID-political correlations
2. **User Training:** Share usage guide with researchers/analysts  
3. **Feedback Collection:** Gather user feedback on interface and features
4. **Data Updates:** Consider adding 2024 election data when available
5. **Enhanced Analytics:** Add statistical correlation analysis features

## üéâ You're Ready!

Run the deployment command and test the integration:

```bash
./sync.sh -i
```

Then open `http://bataleon/covid_elections/` and start exploring the intersection of public health and political geography! üó≥Ô∏èüìä
