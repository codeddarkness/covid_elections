2. Add urban counties:
   - Los Angeles, California
   - Cook, Illinois
   - Harris, Texas
3. Add rural counties:
   - Loving, Texas
   - Kalawao, Hawaii
   - King, Texas
4. Enable political analysis
5. **Result**: Analyze COVID impact differences between politically diverse urban/rural areas

### **Example 3: Purple Counties Study**
1. Focus on competitive counties (45-55% vote share)
2. Examples:
   - Pinellas, Florida (D:49% R:50%)
   - Tarrant, Texas (D:49% R:49%)
   - Macomb, Michigan (D:48% R:50%)
3. **Result**: Study COVID patterns in politically divided communities

## üìà Research Applications

### **1. Policy Effectiveness Analysis**
- Compare mask compliance (survey data) with political leaning
- Analyze vaccination rates vs voting patterns
- Study lockdown compliance across political contexts

### **2. Geographic Correlation Studies**
- Rural Republican counties vs urban Democratic counties
- Suburban swing areas and COVID response
- State-level policy impacts across political spectrum

### **3. Timeline Analysis**
- Early pandemic response (March-June 2020) vs election results
- Vaccine rollout period (2021) political correlation
- Policy change impacts across different political contexts

### **4. Demographic Proxies**
- Political voting patterns as proxy for:
  - Education levels
  - Income distribution
  - Healthcare access
  - Social trust metrics

## üîß Technical Features

### **Data Matching**
- **State Level**: Direct name matching
- **County Level**: "County, State" format parsing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when political data unavailable
- **Performance**: Lazy loading of election data (only when enabled)

### **Visualization Enhancements**
- **Color Coding**: Consistent Democrat blue (#1e40af) and Republican red (#dc2626)

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and screen reader support

### **Data Sources Integration**
- **COVID Data**: The New York Times (2020-2023)
- **Election Data**: MIT Election Data Science Lab (2020)
- **Geographic Matching**: FIPS codes and standardized names
- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation and error reporting

## üì± Mobile Usage

### **Responsive Features**
- Compact political info display on small screens
- Swipeable charts on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly controls and buttons
- Optimized loading for slower connections

### **Mobile-Specific UI**
- Simplified region tags on narrow screens
- Collapsible political summary section
- Vertical chart stacking for better mobile viewing
- Large touch targets for accessibility

## üîç Advanced Analysis Tips

### **1. Correlation Discovery**
- Look for patterns between COVID severity and political lean
- Analyze timing of peaks relative to election periods
- Compare policy compliance across political spectrum

### **2. Temporal Relationships**
- Pre-election period (Jan-Nov 2020) analysis
- Post-election period (Nov 2020-Jan 2021) changes
- Long-term trends through 2021-2023

### **3. Multi-Variable Analysis**
- Combine with demographic data (external sources)
- Cross-reference with policy announcement timelines
- Correlate with news media coverage patterns

### **4. Statistical Considerations**
- Remember: correlation ‚â† causation
- Account for confounding variables (population density, age, income)
- Consider reporting delays and data quality variations
- Use appropriate statistical methods for geographic data

## üö® Important Limitations

### **Data Limitations**
- Election data is snapshot from November 2020
- COVID data spans 2020-2023 (different timeframes)
- Not all regions have both COVID and election data
- Demographic factors may confound relationships

### **Geographic Considerations**
- Some COVID regions don't map to election jurisdictions
- Special cases (NYC boroughs, independent cities) handled separately
- FIPS code mismatches occasionally occur
- Data quality varies by jurisdiction

### **Analytical Cautions**
- Political parties are broad coalitions with internal diversity
- Individual behavior may not match aggregate voting patterns
- Policy implementation varies within jurisdictions
- External factors (media, leadership) influence both datasets
